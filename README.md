# TDD
## Synopsis

This Project was created after an Interview with  [Stevi Deter](http://www.stevideter.com/ "Stevi Deter") - [GitHub - Stevi Deter](https://github.com/stevideter "GitHub - Stevi Deter")
I have worked a lot with creating UnitCases in my academic career. But at job due to various constraint had never use them. When Global ID Group was becoming inclined towards going Cloud and Test Driven Development. I was leaving for bigger opportunities. However at other places where I worked I was not able to get to work on cloud and to using TDD approach to development. This Interview and this repository will help in documenting my experiences with Test Driven Development.

This is a short tutorial on test driven development with C#. In this project I am going to follow the video tutorial on Test Driven Development in C# with NUnit and Moq by Simon Dineen and then add my logic for extending this application to create a better tutorial for TDD with detail documentation.

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.

## License

A short snippet describing the license (MIT, Apache, etc.)
